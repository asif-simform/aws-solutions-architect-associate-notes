## IAM

1. ### What is IAM?

   AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is like a bouncer for your AWS resources. It's a tool that lets you decide who gets into the party (your AWS resources) and what they're allowed to do once they're inside. So, you can manage who can access your stuff and what actions they can take, all from one central place.

2. ### IAM features
    - Shared access to your AWS account
    - Granular permissions
    - Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    - Identity federation
    - Identity information for assurance
    - PCI DSS Compliance
    - Integrated with many AWS services
    - Eventually Consistent
    - Free to use
